Making Thunderbird address book usable with lost eyesight

## Scenario: Searching for an entry your address book
Imagine you want to find out the telephone number and opening hours of a restaurant, a doctor's.

But, problem is, you cannot read any line on your screen.
And you're alone at the moment.

1. Activate Windows' reading function
2. Open Thunderbird address book and type `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`B`
3. Type the first few letters of the name you are searching for
4. Use `Tab` `Tab` and `key up` or `key down`
5. When the speaker announces that the correct entry has been highlighted, then type `Return`.
6. The entry is opened.
7. Type approximately 31 times `Tab` to reach the phone number. And finally, the reader speaks the number out aloud.
8. What about the opening hours? ðŸ¤” You give it a try and just dial that number &hellip; 

## Workaround
1. Use a good smartphone to take a photo of the screen to let it read out the text of the address entry fields. Hopefully.
2. Use a shortcut to call a friend to google that for you &hellip;
3. Or have a friend print out any of your address book entries in large letters ...
OK, but... is this necessary?
