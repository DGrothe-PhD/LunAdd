Making Thunderbird address book usable with lost eyesight

## Available Thunderbird features
Windows screenreading assistance reads aloud any text field you click on. For example if an error message dialog pops up, you hear the content of it. But it does not read aloud any read-only fields of Thunderbird adress book. (*🤷‍♀️If you found that it actually does, by installing some add-on, a special keyboard shortcut, some hidden setting im Windows 10-11, just, please let me know! 🤷‍♀️*)

## Scenario: Searching for an entry your address book
Imagine you want to find out the telephone number and check the opening hours of a restaurant, a doctor's.

But, only trouble is, you cannot read any line on your screen and also you cannot easily navigate with your mouse 🖱️or on the touch screen 💻.
And you're alone at the moment.

1. Activate Windows' reading function
2. Open Thunderbird address book and type `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`B`
3. Type the first few letters of the name you are searching for
4. Use `Tab` `Tab` and `key up` or `key down`
5. When the speaker announces that the correct entry has been highlighted, then type `Return` to enter editing mode.
6. The address card entry is opened.
7. Type approximately 31 times `Tab` to reach the phone number. And finally, the reader speaks the number out aloud.
8. What about the opening hours? 🤔 You give it a try and just dial that number &hellip; 

## Workaround
1. Use a good smartphone to take a photo of the screen to let it read out the text of the address entry fields. Hopefully.
2. Use a shortcut to call a friend to google that for you &hellip;
3. Or have a friend print out any of your address book entries in large letters ...
OK, but... is this necessary?
