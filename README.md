Making Thunderbird address book usable with lost eyesight

## Scenario: Searching for an entry your address book
Imagine you want to find out the telephone number and check the opening hours of a restaurant, a doctor's.

But, only trouble is, you cannot read any line on your screen and also you cannot easily navigate with your mouse 🖱️or on the touch screen 💻.
And you're alone at the moment.

1. Activate Windows' reading function
2. Open Thunderbird address book and type `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`B`
3. Type the first few letters of the name you are searching for
4. Use `Tab` `Tab` and `key up` or `key down`
5. When the speaker announces that the correct entry has been highlighted, then type `Return` to enter editing mode.
6. The address card entry is opened.
7. Type approximately 31 times `Tab` to reach the phone number. And finally, the reader speaks the number out aloud.
8. What about the opening hours? 🤔 You give it a try and just dial that number &hellip;

## Windows Narrator function
### Usability issues
While Narrator is activated, some issues come up like the following examples:
- In one tab of browser, you write a message, then you open a new tab with your mouse and try to type in an URL or a search term. And you cannot type anything there. Sometimes this works, sometimes it does not. However, using `Ctrl`-`T` instead of a mouse click, it works.
- The narrator may read out the surrounding context menu strips of your browser instead of the content of a web page you have just opened.
- In bilingual contexts, the narrator language can mix. (*As I type this on a German OS, I mark one captital letter and it reads out "Großschreibung W" like "grows-shreebenk double-u"... 🤨*)

### Using Narrator with Thunderbird
* Windows screenreading assistance reads aloud any text field you click on. For example if an error message dialog pops up, you hear the content of it.
* But it does not read aloud any read-only fields of Thunderbird adress book.<br>(*🤷‍♀️If you found that it actually does, by installing some add-on, a special keyboard shortcut, some hidden (registry) setting im Windows 10-11, just, please let me know! 🤷‍♀️*)
